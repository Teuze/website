Hi ! I'm Richard.

I was born in October 24th, 1995, in the French city of Grenoble. </br>
As long as I can remember, computers have been a part of my life.

First seeing them as entertaining devices, I soon started to disect them,
and trying to understand how every part interacts with the others in a
hands-on, hardware point of view. It led me to the discovery of open hardware
and open source software, and motivated my first (unfinished) project :
a semi-autonomous hexapod build over the SSC-32 servo board and a Raspberry Pi.
This project helped me a lot in getting a basic understanding of how an operating system works.

Around that time, I got accepted in my local engineering school,
Grenoble INP Esisar, and enrolled in the cybersecurity club,
[The kr[HACK]en][1]. I started solving challenges
on platforms such as [Root-Me][2] and [HackTheBox][3], getting involved in CTFs,
and attending conferences like INS'Hack, [GreHack][4] and [LeHack][5]
(still called Nuit du Hack at that time). 
</br>
I even helped (twice!) organizing [CSAW Europe][6] as the Applied Research manager.

I am now a junior Security Engineer in Hacknowledge, all while being in my
last year of engineering degree in a cybersecurity (I applied for a joint
program with Grenoble INP Ensimag). So far I have studied operating systems,
C and Java programming, software engineering, LAN and intra-AS networking,
and cryptography. I am self-taught in threat modelling, offensive security,
Python and shell scripting, and I hope to take some time soon to get certified
(OSCP and CSSP would be nice!).
